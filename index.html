 <p>Summary:

+ Initial thoughts I heard about the project were do something with mapping/refugees or something with music or a map of alien sightings throughout the world....

+ After talking about nature-loving, care-free days in nature, Guadalupe, and flying fish (here is my favorite clip of flying fish. You may enjoy this as well:) ), we started talking about the pranks that you used to play with Christine. We talked about the strobe light with socks, putting hazelnuts in envelopes, the amazing photoshopped photos of Justin+the holy eggplant, prank phone calls, the Mohave desert phone....and the general idea of connecting with people and realizing that the stranger on the other end of the line is a human too...

+ The above thread led to the explicit articulation of the fact that you have a beautiful aesthetic that involves humor, whimsy, disrupting the monotony of everyday life with "pranks" that change the quality of people's of attention. A project that leverages this aesthetic could be consuming, something that you could get lost in, and could come out beautifully. You thought of some kind of "telephone game" or automated question sent out to random people/people in your community who are all over the world that, on a daily/weekly basis asks questions such as "What did you see in the sky today?" and then answers to these questions are connected and displayed somewhere. You thought of the lovely idea of sending out some kind of "prank" email or website where people would click on something that would result in them having a vague/subtle absurd thing appear when they go to google or some other major website that they are destined to visit (ie. subtle eggplant with a face and other things like that) which would both change the quality of their attention and embody the "prank" / humorous vibe that gives you (and me) such joy. We also talked about ways to connect random people throughout the world by way of "phone"/chatroom (You, me, and everyone we know style...but not exactly;) ) and doing something (or not) with those conversations. We talked around the idea of what it would be like to create random phone number or website that people go on to meet other people and hear about their lives in other places capturing that sentiment of seeing that other people are also humans...

Resources: 

Most of the things here are "about" disrupting attention/ pranks than they are about technical features that concretize your ideas... I will chat with Shaunalynn and Alec about things that may be useful. In the mean time...

Here is the Davis Foster Wallace commencement speech that, makes explicit the deadness of our attention.

In case you haven't seen them, my favorite films that deal with dead attention/ disrupting "everyday life"  are The Good Girl and American Beauty.


Here is the phone thing that I mentioned that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak used to use to connect with people throughout the globe. Here is a film clip of Steve Jobs talking about it. Here is another one

Here is the Mr. Gif tumbr- random gifs.

In case it is useful and/or inspiring brainstorming and in case your print copy is in NH...Here is a digital copy of Yoko Ono's Grapefruit. 

I was thinking that if you wanted to, you could do something where you combine your love of nature and the absurd....here is a clip that made me think of that.</p>

<p>
And starting to code each page required on codepen!
<a href="http://codepen.io/awinchestermaria/pens/public/">here</a>

<br></p>

<p>Problems I'm running into:
<br>
How to format sticky notes to center when on the stickies comments page - text align center doesn't work
<br>
How do I make the stickies scroll left and right on the page that will have all of them on it?
<br>
General js functions: How do I make my form submit on click to the stickies page and have each submission show up on a new stikie as text?
<br>
How do I get the vote button to on click add one to the number on the right?
<br>
How do I get people's text comments to show up below?
<br>
How can I create a counter of votes that will show up as a chart over time?

<br>

Concerns: How can we create compelling enough questions to get the answers we want? The answers should be feasible projects that will be new and create cost-savings.

<p>Thursday March 24. What we accomplished today: I can make stickies from content from a previous page! This was probably going to be the hardest part to figure out, so I'm excited it is done. By next session, I hope to format these stickies' style so that they look more like well spaced postit notes with text that fits. I need help with creating a vote button that keeps track of votes and can chart them over time.</p>
<br>

<p>Thursday March 31. What I accomplished in open work time: formatting look of post-it pages and text area boxes.
What I am getting done by next class: Comments submission page that works. 
What I need help with: I need to have a div that contains text, and when you click on this div, it opens into a new page that contains this same text, but larger. (without any other previous cookies/history/text showing up alongside it).
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
<p>Thursday April 7. I learned more about how to create a local server and store information on it. 
What I'd like to accomplish by next class: Getting information to save to a server outside of local.
What I need help with: Alignment issues on page with all stickies on it. </p>

<br>

<p>Thursday April 14. 
I started a site with an image map that you can click to find out more details about each part of an object.
What I'd like to accomplish: upload everything to github, clean up code
What I need help with: another project I have almost all done except that the links to other pages don't work on ipad and just ipad </p>

<p>Thursday April 21. 
Brainstorming: 1. I'd like to collect all of my videos and recordings from working with Molly -
they really show my excitement in getting something to function properly. I need to collect every page or test page I've made for this course.
I want to be clear that this class has helped me get over my fear of javascript and learn more about what I AM ACTUALLY capable of doing. It's also refreshed my knowledge of HTML and CSS!
2. I want to get my comments pages working right so that the comments stay on each page even after refresh. I need to do the same thing with 
the vote counters. On the page with all of the stickies on it, 
I need to get the links to work not just on the sticky divs, but also on the text inside of them.
3. I need to post all of my Hack Week files to github and I need to update my journal with all of my PPTs on planning this.
I also need all of my BOP model files up - since I want to show something new, not just what everyone's already seen!
<br>
I created a crazy page with div's whose angles match the current temp in F degrees of each city they represent. 
I want to troubleshoot some of the things that are still needing help on my orginal project.
I need help with specifically: links of innertext not working. Hoping to sort this out later with Molly and play with APIs some more.
<br>
<br>
Thursday April 28.
<br>
1. Not knowing what I'm doing at all - to knowing enough to create things I'm excited by. Feeling scared / intimidated by code to feeling proud of things I made.
I want to talk about my next steps and plans for coding!
<br>
2. Get all projects into presentation as well as personal experience and videos.
<br>
3. I need to figure out why my page with weather API won't work on Github but it works locally. 
I need to get my Hack Week site more perfect. I want to get my comments pages working right so that the comments stay on each page even after refresh. I need to do the same thing with 
the vote counters.
<br>
4. Yes, Github - I should add links to these pages in my Github.
